ASD: ARP Spoofing Detector using OpenWrt

## Project Abstract
* ASD (ARP Spoofing Detector) can distinguish ARP spoofing attack attempts and network connections from a VM guest on a bridged network
* ASD was implemented on an OpenWrt-based AP and evaluated on its ability to handle ARP attacks without returning any false positive alarms
* ARP spoofing attack attempts can be monitored using a visualization tool provided in ASD.


## Experimental Setup

* AP: Xiaomi Mi Wi-Fi mini
